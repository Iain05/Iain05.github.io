            I waited, and you didn't come.<br>
            I called, and you didn't answer.<br>
            I knocked, but you weren't home.<br>
            And I realized that I was alone.<br>
            <br>
            I cried, but no one comforted me.<br>
            I screamed, but no one heard me.<br>
            I gave up and laid there.<br>
            Alone. Why was I always alone?<br><br>

            I hurt, but there was no help.<br>
            I begged, but I was ignored.<br>
            I laughed maniacally at my foolishness.<br>
            I knew I was alone.<br><br>

            I was always alone.<br>
            No one was there.<br>
            No matter how many times<br>
            I called knocked, cried, screamed...<br>
            I was alone...forever alone.<br><br>

            I was fake.<br>
            I was imaginary.<br>
            I was a pawn,<br>
            But most of all<br>
            I. Was. Alone.
